# CS500-Assignment-6
1 Problem. Java

This assignment was 1 problem and it was aimed at creating a simple interest rate calculator. The user would enter account ID, account balance, interest rate, amount withdrawn, 
and amount of deposit. This project uses Get and Set methods and private/public variables.

Please let me know how I can improve the code. Thank you.
